    "In this assignment we will cover Image Stitching.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Task:\n",
    "You have been provided with a set of image pairs. For each pair, perform image stitching. It will require novel approaches to achieve the highest accuracy. Using methods introduced in the lecture content, and optionally methods you have researched yourself, design an image stitching pipeline for each pair to achieve optimal results.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Requirements:\n",
    "1. **Design and Implementation**:\n",
    "   - Design an image stitching pipeline for each pair of images.\n",
    "   - Justify each design choice in your pipeline, explaining why you made the decision and showing the practical implications of this design choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Visualization**:\n",
    "   - Visualize the results with visual comparisons (before/after stitching).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Evaluation**:\n",
    "   - Quantitatively evaluate the stitching quality (e.g., reprojection error, if applicable).\n",
    "   - Discuss challenges and potential improvements when you try to get a better result."
